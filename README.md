zotero-report-cleaner
=====================

Tidies up the reports generated by the Zotero reference manager

It is one of the first programming projects I ever did, and so the code is
pretty appalling. But bad open code is better than bad closed code, so here it is.
You can still use the application at http://jasonpriem.org/projects/report_cleaner.php.

I get a fair number of requests for improvements, and I'm sorry to say that between
trying to get a PhD and co-founding a startup, I just don't have time to put
into features on this any more, which makes me sad, but it is
what it is. If you need a feature, feel free to fork and add it!
